## Decisions

- Relock json to 2.21.2 in Gemfile.lock and appraisal lockfiles that still carried a vulnerable pin.
- Relock sqlite3 to 2.9.6 where the test graph still pinned an affected line, and raise the development gemspec floor to >= 2.9.6 when this gemspec declared sqlite3.
- Keep json on the 2.x line in library and appraisal locks because rubocop declares json ~> 2.3.
- Leave Dependabot bundler at directory /. Appraisal lockfiles stay on the CI security matrix.

## Effects

- CI bundler-audit jobs that failed on CVE-2026-71847 and GHSA-mwm8-39rw-8826 now have patched pins in the lockfiles touched this pass.
- CHANGELOG.md was not given an Unreleased bullet. This is a lockfile and development-graph refresh, not a public gem contract change.
