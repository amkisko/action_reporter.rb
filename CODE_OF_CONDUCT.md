# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We operate on principles of mutual respect, privacy, and authentic engagement. We value substantive contributions and clarity on intentions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Authenticity:** Engaging with genuine curiosity and admitting uncertainty rather than feigning knowledge.

* **Responsible Innovation:** Taking full responsibility for any content or code contributed, whether manually written or generated by automation tools.

* **Gentle Correction:** Responding politely to errors. We view mistakes as opportunities for learning, provided they are addressed with humility.

* **Inclusive Language:** Using language that welcomes diverse perspectives and respects the privacy and identity of all participants.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment:** Public or private harassment, trolling, or insulting comments.

* **Weaponized Complexity:** Using jargon or overwhelming volume (including automated spam) to silence others.

* **Publishing Private Information:** Sharing others' data or personal context without explicit permission.

## Artificial Intelligence & Automation

In accordance with our commitment to **Collective Awareness**:

* Contributors are responsible for the accuracy and security of any AI-generated artifacts they submit.

* "The AI wrote it" is not a valid excuse for introducing bugs, security vulnerabilities, or bias.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at contact@kiskolabs.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
